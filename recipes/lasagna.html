<h2>Description</h2>
<p1> Lasagna is a classic italian comfort dish made by layering sheets of pasta and
    rich meat sauce, creamy béchamel or ricotta, and melted cheese. To make it,
     start by cooking ground beef or sausage with onions, garlic, and tomato sauce 
     until thick and flavorful. In a separate bowl, mix ricotta cheese with egg, 
     herbs, and Parmesan. Layer the ingredients in a baking dish—starting with sauce,
      then noodles, cheese mixture, and mozzarella—repeating until full.
       Bake until bubbling and golden brown on top. The result is a hearty,
        satisfying meal perfect for family dinners or gatherings.
