<h2>Description</h2>
<p1>Macaroni and cheese is a comforting, classic dish featuring tender elbow-shaped 
    pasta enveloped in a rich, creamy cheese sauce. The sauce is typically made from
     a blend of melted cheeses—most often cheddar—mixed with butter, milk or cream,
      and a touch of seasoning, creating a smooth, velvety texture that clings 
      perfectly to each noodle. The dish can be served soft and gooey straight from 
      the stove or baked until the top forms a golden, slightly crispy crust. 
      Its flavor is warm and indulgent, with a perfect balance of savory, cheesy 
      goodness and subtle buttery richness, making it a beloved comfort food across 
      generations.</p1>
